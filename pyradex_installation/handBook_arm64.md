# pyradex Installation handbook for arm-64 arch
I hope this could help you deal with the OLD language tool that widly use in radical trandfer modeling.  
I have no idea why x86 is (maybe) better than arm arch, I would prefer working on x86 because it's more similar to Linux.  
But I have already done this on arm, just share it if you want pyradex run on Apple Silicon chips.  

All the 功德屬於寫出 radex, 寫出 wapper, 在 stackOverflow 上幫助我的 brillirant brain and GenAI.  
(怎麼標注別人的 repo 啊)
