## Environment (2025.12.27)
**feifei:** macOS Sequoia 15.6.1, M3 chip (arm-64)  
..  

**Lab computer:** Ubuntu20.04  
Model fitting requires computational powerrrr, so I perform those tasks on desktop.  
Thought I may not use `pyradex` for modeling, I still need to mention that I could only make `pyradex` works on Linux now. :(
