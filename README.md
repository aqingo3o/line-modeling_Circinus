## data/
There are `.dat` files that used for modeling.   
Data cubes from ALMA are in the local data/, I'm not sure if those are public data... so only `.dat` files here.  
To get the `.dat`s, please check [where-to-get-dat.md](../docs/where-to-get-dat.md). (just download from [LAMDA](https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/), 23333)

如果做了什麼好的的話，將會放在這裡。  

## scripts/
從 [exp/](../exp) 來的東西，相對稍微經過測試的好版  
也包含一些有用小工具，總之是推薦的一個好物聚集。
