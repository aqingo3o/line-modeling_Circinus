## Environment (2025.12.27)
**feifei:** macOS Sequoia 15.6.1, M3 chip (arm-64)  
The work largely relies on a virtual environment created with x86-miniconda via Rosetta2 to run x86-64 arch on fefei.  
The main programming language in the venv is Python 3.10,  
and the python packages used are listed in `astro_py310_(date).yml`.
The .yml file 請參考下面設定。


**Lab computer:** Ubuntu20.04  
Model fitting requires computational powerrrr, so I perform those tasks on desktop.  
I use a virtual environment created via x86-miniconda, and the .yml file is 
Thought I may not use `pyradex` for modeling, I still need to mention that I could only make `pyradex` works on Linux now. :(  

## Tools
- CASA 6.4.1 (Ubuntu 20+)
- modular CASA (via Rosetta2)
- CARTA v5.0.0(feifei), v4(Lab)
- python 3.10
- `pyradex` (Lab) (?)
- `numpy==1.26.2`
