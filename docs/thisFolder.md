about this folder :)

## pyradex_patches/ 
Since the patches comes from a fortran 大菜雞, please use it carefully with [installation-handBook_pyradex.md](../docs/installation-handBook_pyradex.md).  
Referenced from [keflavich/pyradex](https://github.com/keflavich/pyradex). Tthe repo may be updated, so please refer to keflavich's repo for the most accurate information.

## installation-handBook_pyradex.md  
這真的巨媽麻煩，好消息是建模主體並不會用到 `pyradex`，只是因為誤會了什麼所以才 work on installing `pyradex` :(  

## installation-hint_RADEX.md  
Actually, [RADEX's official website](https://sronpersonalpages.nl/~vdtak/radex/index.shtml) already explains it very clearly, so this is just a note.
## try_radex-pipeline.md   
The logs(natural language) of running [this series](../scripts/radex-pipeline) of programs.
Aside from lots of unnecessary details, this is quite valuable for reference, and also record the script's evolution tree. Recommended:)

## where-to-get-dat.md  
As the filename, it explains where and how to get `.dat` files. Please don't laugh because I genuinely didn't know where to find these files at first.
I thought RADEX would download them automaticallyt?
